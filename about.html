     <h1>ABOUT THE WATER BAR</h1>



     <p> The Water Bar is a concept that was brought to life by the famous chef Sarah Zientek.
     After becoming extremely well renowned in the competitive field of ice sculpting,
     she put her knowledge of water and its various forms to use by creating her very own water
     restaurant. A female buisness owner and visionary, her Water Bar now has three locations in the
     heart of Paris, France. Her passion for water is obvious throught the exquisite selection of waters
     found on the menu.
     <br>
     <br>
     The 3 Michelin Star restaurants feature high dining experiences with the highest quality waters brought from all over the world.
